# CSS Framework Project 

Your CSS framework should support the following features. Use this checklist to mark off each feature as you complete it. 

Your goal is to check off everything in this list. 

These things don't need to be extensively styled. Some may not need a style. They all need your consideration. Take a look at each item and see how it looks under your CSS framework. To see the style you should mock it up in your demo documentation. 

Check off each item as you complete it.
