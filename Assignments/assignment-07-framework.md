# FEW 2.2 - Assignment 4 - CSS Framework

This is the first part of a larger assignment to create a CSS framework. 

What is a CSS framework? A framework is a library of code that has opinion about how things should be done. Your CSS framework should supply basic styles and take an opinion about what looks good on the web and how styles should be applied. 

Your goal is create a framework that can be used to build better looking web pages. 

Your framework will have the following features which you will implement across separate assignments from now til the end of the term. 

The first step of this assignment is to define some font styles.

### Why this assignment?

Understand how type works and the features of typography will make your projects look better and be more engaging. 

## Project requirements

You should create a new Repo that will host your CSS framework.

You will test your work against two sample files. The first file is the sample markup here: 

https://github.com/Make-School-Labs/css-framework-starter

Find a past project or other web page you can test your framework against. This can be any HTML page. Remove any styles this page previouly used. 

Think of a name for your CSS framework. Seriously, it needs a name, it's a product, no really it is and like any other product it needs a name. 

- Frmwrk
- FramwÃ«rk
- Ninja CSS
- Chonky CSS
- CSSS - Chonky Styles Solidly Served
- CSSSS - CSS Served with Solid Sagacious Style 
- CSSSSS - Colorful Simple Seamless and Safely Served Styles 

Seriously, your CSS framework needs a name. Make up a name. 

Name your CSS file after your framework. **The framework CSS should not be named: style.css!**

Copy your sample HTML files into the folder with your framework css repo and link them to your CSS files. 

Add some styles! 

What will your CSS framework look like? Your CSS framework will be a CSS file. Yep, it will be a single CSS file. 

You can build your CSS file from SASS, break this up inot several .scss files but it should compile to a single .css file. 

Anyone who wants to use your CSS framework should only have to download the .css file and link to it in head of their HTML document. 

### Styling type

Start by styling type. Set a default font style for your framework. Follow these steps: 

- [ ] Named your CSS framework
- [ ] Made a Repo
  - [ ] Copied Sample files into Repo
- [ ] Choose a font 
  - It's probably best to use a system font. See the notes in lesson 4. 
  - The big decision here is choose between a serif or sans-serif font family. 
- [ ] Set a default font style on thhe body element. 
  - Define your default font style by styling the body tag. 
  - Set the font-family
  - Set the font-size
  - Set the line-height
  - Set the fore ground color 
  - Set the background color
- [ ] Set a style for the headings h1-6
  - [ ] Set the sizes of each of these. 
  - [ ] Set other styles to get a look that you like. Consider these: 
    - margin-top and margin-bottom
    - color 
    - font-weight
    - letter-spacing
- [ ] Style other text elements 
  - [ ] strong
  - [ ] em
  - [ ] a
  - [ ] abbr
  - [ ] code (this might use a different font - probably a fixed width font)

You may not specifically define styles for everyone of the elements above, but you should consider the styles for each of these. 

### Deliverable

A link to the branch of your project with the improved typography.
