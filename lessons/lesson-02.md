# FEW 2.2 - Advanced CSS - Animation

Making things move.

## Why you should know this

Engagment is important. Things that move are much more interesting. Adding motion adds another dimention to your content. All of your favorite apps probably have little bits of animation.

## Learning Objectives

1. Describe easing
1. Use CSS transition and keyframes to make things move
1. Control and define the time and easing for elements that move

## Identify some Examples of motion

Look for motion in software products that you use. 

Pair and share these with your partner. 

## Initial Exercise

Animation is everywhere on the computer. Even your code editor has some animation. Small animations can be informative and engaging. 

When you see motion on the computer what is happening? Most often that motion is connected to the properties that set the position, scale, rotation, and opacity. 

Explore some CSS animations and identify what properties are being animated.

What is happening in these animations? Don't worry about the technical details just _identify which properties are changing_.

## Making things move

There are a couple ways to make things move with CSS. 

- `transition`
- `@keyframe`

In a nutshell `transition` causes changes to CSS properties to change over time instead of changing instantly, `@keyframe` defines changes that are mapped out over time. Transition animates a change to a property keyframes map out changes that are then applied to properties. 

### Transition

```CSS
.a {
  width: 100px;
  height: 100px;
  background-color: #f00;
  /* Sets the time to apply changes to this element */
  transition: 400ms;
  /* s = secs ms = milliseconds  */
}

.a:hover {
  /* These changes occur over the transition time set above */
  transform: scale(1.25) rotate(12deg);
}
```

The base rule declares a transition of 400 milliseconds. The hover rule changes the scale and rotation. Rather than happening immediately the change takes 400 milliseconds.

https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Transitions/Using_CSS_transitions

### Keyframes

To create keyframe animations define some keyframes. A key frame describes the values for CSS properties at a point in time. 

Assign keyframe animation a name, `scaleAndRotate` in the example below. 

Define the value for properties along the length of the animation. Here `transform: scale(0.5) rotate(0)` happens at the beginning `0%`, `background-color: blue` happens at the half way point `50%`, and `transform: scale(1.0) rotate(23deg)` happens at the end of the animation `100%`.
```CSS
@keyframes scaleAndRotate {
  0% { transform: scale(0.5) rotate(0); }
  50% { background-color: blue; }
  100% { transform: scale(1.0) rotate(23deg); }
}
```

The code above defines the animation. Below the animation is applied to an element. 

The `animation` property applies an animation to an element. The line: `animation: scaleAndRotate 5s infinite` sets the animation to `scaleAndRotate` (matches the name above), sets the length of the animation 5 secs (`5s`), and repeat infinitely (`infinite`).

```CSS
div {
  width: 100px;
  height: 100px;
  background: red;
  position :relative;
  /*         name     duration iteration-count */
  animation: scaleAndRotate 5s infinite;
}
```

The animation property is the shorthand property for: 

- animation-delay
- animation-duration
- animation-fill-mode
- animation-iteration-count
- animation-name
- animation-play-state
- animation-timing-function

The code above could be broken into three lines: 

```CSS
animation-name: scaleAndRotate;
animation-duration: 5s;
animation-iteration-count: infinite;
```

## Easing 

Easing describes the change in rate of motion. When things speed up, think a car starting from a stop sign, we say they are easing in. When things slow down, think a car slowing as it reaches a stop sign, we say they are easing out. 

Everythin in the real world eases in or eases out. You should always apply easing. This will give your motion character and make it more realistic and interesting to watch.

## Making things move with CSS

Pair up with someone you haven't paired with in class before and take a look at these tutorials. The idea is to find some things you can incorporate into your logo/icon.

## Homework: Animation

Follow these videos tutorials. These videos walk through how to solve all of the challenegs in the homework. These also cover ideas that go beyond what's in the homework.

Recreate the animations here using CSS transitions.

Add some motion to your CSS drawing/logo:

It's easiest to use `transition` for interactive animations on hover or click and `@keyframes` for a cycling animations or complex animations. See the link below for a detailed description of the homework:
